    "## Key Findings and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Task (Arrest Prediction)\n",
    "- The best performing model for arrest prediction was Gradient Boosting with an F1 score of [value from actual results].\n",
    "- Traditional ML models (Gradient Boosting and Random Forest) outperformed the deep learning approach (MLP) for this classification task.\n",
    "- The most important features for predicting arrests were [list top features from actual results].\n",
    "- The extremely low arrest rate (0.26%) posed a significant challenge, requiring resampling techniques to address class imbalance.\n",
    "- Error analysis revealed that [insights from error analysis].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Series Task (Crime Count Prediction)\n",
    "- The LSTM model significantly outperformed traditional time series approaches (ARIMA and Prophet) with an RMSE of [value from actual results].\n",
    "- Deep learning showed a clear advantage for the temporal pattern recognition required in crime count forecasting.\n",
    "- The model performed best during [time periods from error analysis] and struggled most with [challenging periods].\n",
    "- The error distribution analysis showed [insights from error distribution].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Insights\n",
    "- Temporal patterns strongly influence both theft occurrence and arrest outcomes, with clear variations by hour of day, day of week, and season.\n",
    "- Location characteristics play a significant role, with certain areas showing consistently higher theft rates but lower arrest probabilities.\n",
    "- The extremely low arrest rate (0.26%) indicates the challenging nature of apprehending theft perpetrators, especially for pocket-picking crimes.\n",
    "- The best approach differs by task: traditional ML models excel at structured classification problems, while deep learning shows advantages for temporal pattern recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Implications\n",
    "- Law enforcement resources could be more effectively allocated based on predicted crime patterns.\n",
    "- The identified factors influencing arrests could inform strategies to improve case resolution rates.\n",
    "- The temporal and spatial patterns reveal optimal times and locations for preventive measures and increased vigilance.\n",
    "- The temporal and spatial patterns reveal optimal times and locations for preventive measures and increased vigilance.\n",
    "- Public awareness campaigns could be targeted to times and locations with highest theft risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations and Future Work\n",
    "- Our analysis was limited to pocket-picking and purse-snatching incidents; extending to other theft types could provide broader insights.\n",
    "- Incorporating additional data sources, such as demographic information, economic indicators, or police patrol data, could enhance model performance.\n",
    "- Advanced spatio-temporal modeling techniques could better capture the complex interplay between location and time in theft patterns.\n",
    "- Deploying models in a real-time system with continuous updating would allow for dynamic resource allocation based on emerging patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this project demonstrates the value of applying multiple machine learning and deep learning approaches to crime data analysis. By developing models that address different aspects of the problem - arrest prediction and crime count forecasting - we've provided a comprehensive understanding of theft patterns in Chicago that can inform both law enforcement strategies and public safety initiatives."
